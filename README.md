# Graphics

This repository contains various graphics drawn for SEEMOO papers and presentations. We do not aim at making
this a complete library, but providing special graphics in a common style.

Most figures were designed by Jiska Classen and polished for her PhD thesis.
Vanessa Hahn created the satellite, cat, and item finder icons.
